A. Core Values:

	We here at JIGS strongly believe in helping those in need and we are committed to helping create a more accessible and inclusive world. Within both the company and outside of it we want to break down barriers, social, cultural, language, etcetera, and create a world free of lost translations through the development of wearable technology and we will not compromise on these goals. This should not only be reflected in the technology itself, but our employees, family, as well, for we strive to foster a sense of collaboration and creativity. We are also driven to lead the way in the field of augmented reality and advanced learning algorithms, as well as further the research into them in order to better gain an understanding of the technology and to find new applications. Through this we are able to foster a sense of curiosity and adaptability as the world changes and advances around us, as well as change and advance it ourselves.

B. Motivations:

	We here at JIGS are motivated by the vastness, diversity and differences that every person, culture, and country on planet Earth inherits. Combine this with our love for innovation and curiosity that we want to gain the ability to better understand the many different people and places around us, and pass that ability onto others. We want to see relatives born on opposite ends of the world see and understand each other for the first time; people with hearing disabilities be able to listen and communicate with their loved ones. This shouldn’t stop at just accomplishing our goal of a more understandable world, but we also want to find ways to make the technology more accessible, such as through costs and availability, and broaden the scope of what our products and industry are capable of.
