A. Company Name: JIGS

B. Long Term Vision Statement:

  1. What are our goals?
	    The goal of our project is to create glasses with a display interface that can pick up and decipher others' voices nearby and translate them into a readable language of the user's choice on the glasses' display.


  2. Where did our idea come from?
	    Our idea comes from the needs of people with hearing disabilities as well as the need to break language barriers.


  3. What is the purpose, values and mission?
	    Our purpose is to help those who are hard of hearing as well as bring the world a little closer together by providing a way for those who do not speak each other's languages to communicate more easily.

     How can our startup have an impact?
	    Our finished product will immediately be an invaluable asset to those who have recently lost their hearing capacity as otherwise they would have to find other methods to communicate effectively (learn sign language, have an interpreter, use some other device, etc.), all of which could take a lot of time to learn in which the individual wouldn't be able to operate normally as they had previously. While hearing aids may be able to solve some cases, it doesn't solve all of them.

     What engages our passions?
	    Those of us at JIGS have a strong desire to do our part in helping those in need. Our goal to implement a translation feature is secondary to our primary objective: which is aiding those with hearing disabilities.
